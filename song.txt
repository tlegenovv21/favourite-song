One day, I was trying to drink tea
I put the kettle on to boil water
and then, I thought about you for a while
I closed my eyes for a while
The honey-like scent
I inhaled in
 
On my cheeks
a couple of tears fell down
I didn't know why
I felt this way
although it was weird
although it was a little sad
I somehow cried
because it was so sweet

because it was so sweet

One day, I just took the train
I leaned my head on the window and fell asleep
Actually, I thought about you a lot
until your clear face
became blurred
 
Ah –
 
One, two, three, four
On my cheeks
a couple of tears fell down
I didn't know why
I felt this way
although it was weird
although it was a little sad
I somehow cried
because it was so sweet

because it was so sweet
because it was so sweet
sweet
